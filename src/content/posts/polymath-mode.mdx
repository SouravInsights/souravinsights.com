Ever since I can remember, I’ve been excited about everything.

One day I want to master the guitar. The next, I’m neck-deep in the source code of some obscure API. Then I’ll find myself watching a video about the mysteries of black holes, reading about how Napoleon planned his military campaigns, or dreaming about building my own product that solves a problem no one’s even thought of yet. I’m a software engineer by profession and by passion, but that’s just one slice of the pie. My interests branch into singing, playing guitar, hacking (ethical or not), traveling, physics, current affairs, writing, teaching, and even collecting the most unnecessary and random facts that most people would ignore. I love asking questions. I love understanding how things work. I want to know the 'why' behind everything.

In short, I want to be a polymath. The greatest polymath, if I could.

But there’s a catch.

Sometimes I’m hyper-focused—lost in code, oblivious to the world, solving bugs that felt impossible just an hour ago. Other times, I’m scattered—half-reading five books, switching between twenty tabs, dabbling in things that don’t seem to connect, and feeling like I’ve accomplished nothing substantial. I want to do everything, but I often end up half-doing a dozen things instead. This constant switching between obsessive focus and chaotic curiosity leaves me exhausted. Sometimes inspired. But often…unfulfilled.

So I’ve started diving deep into this question—not as someone who’s figured it all out, but as someone genuinely trying to. I’m reading books, following studies, collecting techniques, and testing strategies on myself. What follows isn’t advice—it’s field notes. My attempt to make sense of what it means to want to do everything without completely burning out.

## The Polymath Paradox

The desire to learn everything isn’t new. Leonardo da Vinci was an artist, engineer, scientist, and philosopher. Richard Feynman wasn’t just a Nobel-winning physicist—he was a safe-cracker, an artist, and a bongo player. Benjamin Franklin was a writer, inventor, scientist, and statesman. They didn’t just dabble—they mastered. And yet they didn’t master everything at once.

That’s the paradox I keep running into: polymathy is not multitasking. It’s sequential, not simultaneous. It’s about zooming into one domain deeply, emerging with insight, and then moving to the next with discipline and intent.

So the goal isn’t to tame curiosity. It’s to schedule it.

## Why Our Brains Struggle with “Doing Everything”

From what I’ve read, our brains are great at focusing—but terrible at constant switching. The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for attention and goal-setting, can only hold a handful of items at once. When I switch from writing to checking Twitter to debugging code to learning about space-time, it creates what the American Psychological Association calls a "switching cost." These costs aren’t trivial—studies show we can lose up to 40% of productive time (APA, 2006).

Add to that the dopamine effect. Every new idea, notification, or tab triggers a reward response. This creates a feedback loop that rewards exploration over execution. According to Dr. Anna Lembke in _Dopamine Nation_, we’re wired to pursue what’s novel even if it sabotages our long-term goals.

This hit me hard. It explains why I often abandon my deepest interests at the shallowest moment: I chase the feeling of “starting” rather than the discomfort of finishing.

## What I’ve Learned (So Far)

I’m now experimenting with frameworks that balance exploration with execution. Here are some that resonated with me—not because I’ve mastered them, but because they’ve helped bring some order to the chaos.

### 1. Deep Work & Focus Blocks

I learned this from Cal Newport’s _Deep Work_. He defines it as "professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit." I now try to block 90-minute sessions for just one thing: whether that’s writing, coding, or learning guitar. It’s uncomfortable at first, but strangely addictive once you get into it.

### 2. Ultradian Rhythm Breaks

I picked this up from _The Power of Full Engagement_. Our bodies operate in 90-minute focus cycles. Pushing past that leads to mental fatigue. So after each 90-minute sprint, I take a walk, nap, or just stare at the ceiling. Oddly, this makes me sharper for the next block.

### 3. Daily Highlights (Make Time)

From _Make Time_ by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky, I learned to choose just one highlight for the day. That becomes my “win,” no matter what else happens. It gives structure without pressure.

### 4. Building a Second Brain

I use Obsidian to capture random thoughts, insights, quotes, and project ideas. This is inspired by Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten method and expanded in _How to Take Smart Notes_. It stops me from acting on every impulse, but still honors the idea by storing it.

### 5. Curiosity Slots

I now allocate guilt-free time for rabbit holes. I treat these like “mini-sabbaths” for the mind. Saturday afternoons? Dive into Feynman lectures. Random Wednesday night? Watch 3 videos on quantum tunneling. This gives my brain what it craves without destroying my focus blocks.

### 6. The Feynman Method

Feynman’s technique of carrying 12 problems in your head changed how I think. Now, when I encounter something interesting, I test it against my personal problem list. It forces me to stay anchored. I got this from _Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!_ and various blogs from his students.

## Enter the Age of GPTs: The Supertook for Polymaths

Here’s the part that excites me the most: we’re living in a time where GPTs and large language models exist. That changes the game for people like me—people who want to explore, connect dots, and execute ideas faster than ever.

These days, when I’m feeling stuck or my mind’s all over the place, I just type straight into GPT like it’s a blank notepad that talks back. It’s way better than juggling twenty open tabs or falling into a YouTube rabbit hole for hours.

> Some things I’ve actually asked recently:

- I have 2 hours today. What’s the fastest way to learn how zod works with tRPC?
- Give me some short exercises to test if I’ve really understood what I read in Deep Work.
- Why does my useEffect sometimes run twice in development, and how does React’s rendering behavior actually work under the hood?
- Help me reflect: Why do I always abandon books halfway?
- I want to build a new learning habit. Suggest a 30-day challenge based on spaced repetition.
- Can you explain how cache: 'force-cache' and revalidate work with fetch in Next.js? And when should I not use them?
- Can you turn this inner chaos I feel into a poetic 3-liner?
- What’s a common strumming pattern in Coke Studio-style songs?
- What’s the difference between major and minor scales—explain in emotion terms.
- I’ve always wanted to understand relativity—but through the lens of intuition and analogies. Can you walk me through the basics like Feynman would?

What used to take days or weeks now happens in minutes. It’s like carrying a tutor, a co-founder, a sounding board, and a research assistant in your pocket.

But even here—discipline matters. It’s easy to get caught up using GPT for shallow things. The real magic happens when you pair it with _intentional curiosity_ and _deep structure_.

For example:

- I use GPT to help me generate writing prompts, then go offline to write uninterrupted.
- I outline big ideas with AI, then follow up with deep work blocks to refine and build.
- I’ve even used GPT to help me teach myself guitar theory by translating complicated music jargon into beginner-friendly explanations.

It’s not a shortcut—it’s a **scaffold**. GPT accelerates learning, but only if you’re willing to do the focused follow-up.

## Reality Check: It’s Messy

Despite all this, I still struggle. I still go on binge-learning sprees. I still drop books halfway. I still feel like I’m doing too much and not enough at the same time. But I now recognize that part of the polymath journey is **pattern-building** over time. These small tools, books, and rhythms are helping me stitch together a system that honors both my obsession with doing everything—and my desire to actually finish something.

Also, I’ve realized that curiosity isn’t the enemy. It’s raw fuel. But just like any fuel, it needs containment. It needs structure. That structure doesn’t have to be rigid, but it has to exist.

## Conclusion: Polymathy as a Process, Not an Identity

I used to think being a polymath meant being good at everything. Now, I think it means staying **in love with learning**, while gradually deepening your craft across domains.

I haven’t figured it out. I’m still learning how to organize my days, control my dopamine, fight distraction, and move with intention. But this essay, in a way, is part of the practice. It’s a snapshot of the journey—not the destination.

So no, this isn’t a guide. It’s a dispatch from the field.

And if you’re like me—curious, distracted, overly ambitious—you’re not alone.

We’re all trying to build a brain that can do everything.

**Just not all at once.**
