                , our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by
                them, so it's instrumental that our websites progress along with
                us.

                With algorithms now prioritizing content that is loud and
                outrageous and from people with a huge following, it has been
                increasingly harder for people to get their voice heard. Also,
                we don't own our content anymore; what if all the popular
                platforms we use to share our ideas & thoughts cease to exist?
              </p>
              <p>
                Our content is not just something we have created but it is also
                part of our identity. It is part of who we are, what we are
                thinking, what we believe in. It is part of the story we are
                about to tell. Our content is one of our most valuable assets
                and thus owning it is invaluable.
