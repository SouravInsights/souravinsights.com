# 🌿 My Digital Garden

Welcome to my Digital Garden - a dynamic, customizable curation of my favorite links and resources. This project serves as an extension of myself, housing curations and insights from various sources

## 🌟 Features

- 📊 Discord Integration: Automatically fetches and displays links shared on one of my private Discord server
- 🎨 Customizable Themes: Multiple card designs to showcase links in visually appealing ways (hope you like them 🥹)
- 🌓 Dark/Light Mode: Switch between dark and light themes (not properly implemented for all card designs, I'm working on it... 🙃)
- 🔍 Search Functionality: Easily find specific links across all categories (could be improved a lot)
- 📱 Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- 📈 Analytics Integration: Track link popularity and user engagement with PostHog (super awesome too I must say)
- 🔄 Load More: Efficiently handle large numbers of links with "Load More" functionality
- 🐍 Interactive Footer: Features a fun "Language Muncher" Snake game, to make the footer less boring 😅
